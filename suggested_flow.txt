When the user attempts to open a log file, the first thing the extension must do is to send this command to the rust binary:
{"GetLogMetadata": "/path/to/file"}
This will return 2 things: the first is encoding->bool ( is this encoding supported or not) if the encoding is not supported simply return an error screen explaining that the extension only supports utf8, utf16, Latin-1, Windows-1252 and anything else compatible with ASCII. The second thing this command will return (which won't matter if the encoding is not supported) is the structure of the logs, if the logs follow one of the default structures defined in @popular_log_formats.txt the program will automatically parse the data following the same regex defined structure, however if the program returned OTHER type then the user before seeing the text will have to fill a small good looking form prompting them to enter the regex patterrn matching each line of the logs and the number of columns they expect. Those fields are optional, if the user failed to provide them, the data won't be parsed and syntax highlighting will not work. The extension must aggregate the data and send it as an OpenFile command to the rust backend, the rest of the commands: Search and GetChunk won't change.
