# Platform-Specific Binaries

This directory contains platform-specific compiled binaries of the FatFile Rust backend.

## Binary Naming Convention

Binaries follow the naming pattern: `FatFile-{platform}-{arch}[.exe]`

- **Linux x64**: `FatFile-linux-x64`
- **macOS x64 (Intel)**: `FatFile-darwin-x64`
- **macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)**: `FatFile-darwin-arm64`
- **Windows x64**: `FatFile-win32-x64.exe`

## Automatic Builds

These binaries are automatically generated by GitHub Actions when:
- Pushing to the main/master branch
- Creating a new release tag (v*)
- Manually triggering the workflow

## Manual Build

To build the binaries manually:

```bash
cd ../RustBackend
cargo build --release --target <rust-target>
```

Then copy the binary to this directory with the appropriate name.

## Notes

- Binaries are gitignored and not committed to the repository
- The extension automatically detects the platform and loads the correct binary
- Development builds fall back to `../RustBackend/target/release/FatFile` if platform-specific binary is not found
